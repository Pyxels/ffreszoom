# ffreszoom

ffreszoom (name shamelessly stolen from the [Chome equivalent,
reszoom](https://github.com/raboof/reszoom)) is a Firefox extention that sets
zoom level based on screen resolution. This should only be useful on Linux
desktops with multiple mixed DPI screens. ffreszoom zooms to 200% on the HiDPI
screen to work around poor X11 mixed DPI handling. If/when Firefox gets proper
Wayland support, this extention will no longer be necessary.
