# ffreszoom

ffreszoom (name shamelessly stolen from the [Chome equivalent,
reszoom](https://github.com/raboof/reszoom)) is a Firefox extention that sets
zoom level based on screen resolution. The main use case is Linux X11 setups
with more than one screen, where one screen's DPI is much higher than the
other. ffreszoom zooms to 200% on the HiDPI screen to work around X11's poor
mixed DPI handling.
